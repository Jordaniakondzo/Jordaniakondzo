# Neural ODEs Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring the capabilities of **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)** through practical examples from the [`torchdiffeq` library](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq), specifically leveraging scripts from the `examples` directory.

## About Neural ODEs

Neural ODEs represent a groundbreaking approach in deep learning. They treat the depth of neural networks as a continuous variable, offering more precise control over model dynamics. This method is ideal for tasks involving irregular time series data.

## Repository Structure

We provide modified and annotated versions of scripts from the `torchdiffeq` repository, focusing on different Neural ODE architectures and their performance on various tasks.

## Goals

- **Educational Insight**: Provide clear examples and explanations that showcase the functionality and advantages of Neural ODEs.
- **Practical Applications**: Demonstrate the versatility of Neural ODEs in solving complex dynamic problems.
- **Community Engagement**: Foster further research and innovation in the field of Neural ODEs.
